## Potential Steps

### 1. Setup Command:

This command would allow the event organizer to set up the basic parameters of the event. Here are some of the options that could be included:

- Type of event (Video, Audio)
- Type of economy (Free, Paid)
- Seat disposition (Theater-style, Classroom-style, Round tables, etc.)
- Seat attribution (First-come, First-served, Reservation-based, etc.)
- Event date and time
- Channel (Channel ID, New Channel)
- Custom Video (Upload a custom video to be played during the event)

### 2. Enter Event:

This command would allow participants to enter the event. They would need to provide their receipt ID (if it's a paid event) and may have the option to leave a money tip.

### 3. Premium Seats:

This command would allow participants to upgrade their seats to premium seats for an extra payment. Premium seats may come with better quality audio or video and the option to download the video after the event.

### 4. Event Calendar:

This command would display a calendar of upcoming events. Users could filter events by location (worldwide or guild-only) and see basic information about each event, such as the date, time, and type of event.
